I use to code in VB 6.0 years ago as of 2022. I can edit code with instructions, like C# and VB others also I suppose. Thinking of diving into F# but don't know anything about it.
I like looking at code and figuring out what goes where, with instructions of course and mostly get things right sometimes I have to look 
for the answer in other places. I really enjoy working with databases and seeing a database all come together and have it working
is a gratifying experience.
